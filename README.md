# Credit-Default-Prediction-
A machine learning model to predict credit card default risk based on customer behaviour, transactions, and credit bureau data. Developed for Bank A as part of an IIT Bombay case study to enable risk-based management of existing credit card customers.
# Credit Card Behaviour Score Prediction

Overview

This project is part of a case study from **IIT Bombay** for **Bank A**, focused on developing a **Behaviour Score** for existing credit card customers. The Behaviour Score is a predictive model that estimates the probability of default for each customer, helping the bank manage credit risk more effectively.

The primary goal is to use historical data to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their credit card payments. This model can then be deployed for risk-based customer management and portfolio optimization.

Project Objectives

- Build a robust **predictive model** using customer behavioural, transaction, and bureau data.
- Predict the **probability of default (bad_flag)** for each customer.
- Generate predictions on **validation data**.
- Provide detailed **documentation and insights** for stakeholders.

Features & Functionality

- Preprocessing of structured financial data
- Handling of missing values and outliers
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Performance evaluation using AUC, log loss, and confusion matrix
- Prediction of default probabilities on unseen validation data
- Export of predictions in the required submission format

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two main files:

- **Development Data**: 96,806 credit card records with input features and the `bad_flag` (target variable).
- **Validation Data**: 41,792 credit card records with the same input features but without the target. Used for inference only.

The features include:
- `onus_attributes_*`: On-us credit limit and usage behavior
- `transaction_attribute_*`: Transaction frequency and amounts
- `bureau_*`: Tradeline level credit history from bureaus
- `bureau_enquiry_*`: Credit enquiry data from bureaus
